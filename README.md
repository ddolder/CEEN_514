# CEEN_514
Get Started with GitHub

In this class, I would like to learn about web programming and how to collaborate with others. I think it is important, and will be able to apply it in my future jobs. In the places were I worked, we never use programming, so it is going to be a good think for me to have this knowledge.

In our project, we are going to work basically with viewshed. I worked with this tool in CEEN 414, but I think it is going to be intresting to work with it in a dinamic way. We are going to start working with the Seattle City because the shapefiles that we need are available in this City, and then we'll try to extend it to another cities.
